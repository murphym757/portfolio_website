# README

This is my portfolio website. I used various concepts and merged them together to create this beautiful website. The website design is a scrollspy-like concept. I chose this design based on its simple and straight-to-the-point flow. Its heavier on sass (css) then anything else. That being said, it does contain elements of HTML5 and JavaScript. All of which, is being tied together with Ruby on Rails.
